Runtimes
 
  The <runtimes> module is a parent for the various implementations of
  a runtime for the framework.

  A 'runtime' in this context means providing some or all of:

  * object persistence

  * object identity management

  * bootstrapping the framework

  * service location / dependency injection

  []

  The only implementation currently available is:

  * {{{./dflt/index.html}Default runtime}}

  The <dflt> (default) runtime implementation (as inherited originally
  from Naked Objects Framework) provides all of these services.  Other
  implementations may provide a subset of these (eg the 'embedded' runtime),
  or provide all of these features but using different technologies.


  []

  In the future we may provide other runtimes, eg to integrate with CDI, or to
  support build-time tooling (eg a Maven plugin).
